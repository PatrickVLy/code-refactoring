# code-refactoring

Step 1: 
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements


added semantic elements to the code. used  &60header&62&60/header&62,  &60nav&62&60/nav&62,  &60section&62</section&62,  &60aside&62 &60/aside&62 &60article&62 &60/article&62, and  &60footer&62 &60/footer&62 tags

Step 2: 
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

edited logical structure of elements. moved  &60aside&62 section so that it is below  &60section&62 tag

Step 3: 
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes

added alt attributes to all  &60img&62 tags

Step 4:
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order

made sure headings were used correctly in sequential order. ie.  &60 h1&62 &60 h2&62 &60 h3&62

Step 5:
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

edited title to "Horiseon - Digital Media Marketing"
