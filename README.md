# code-refactoring

Step 1: 
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements


added semantic elements to the code. used  header, section, aside, article, footer tags

Step 2: 
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

edited logical structure of elements. moved  aside element so that it is below section tag

Step 3: 
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes

added alt attributes to all img tags

Step 4:
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order

made sure headings were used correctly in sequential order. ie.  h1, h2, h3

Step 5:
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

edited title to "Horiseon - Digital Media Marketing"
